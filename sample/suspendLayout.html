        Whether 60 or 16, there is in every human being’s heart the lure of wonders,
        the unfailing appetite for what’s next and the joy of the game of living.
        In the center of your heart and my heart, there is a wireless station; so long as it receives
        messages of beauty, hope,
        courage and power from man and from the infinite, so long as you are young.
        When your aerials are down, and your spirit is covered with
        snows of cynicism and the ice of pessimism, then you’ve grown old, even at 20;
        but as long as your aerials are up, to catch waves of optimism,
        there’s hope you may die young at 80. </p>
